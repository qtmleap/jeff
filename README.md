# Jeff

> **New: v1.1 (29 September 2026).** Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B and Jeff-Qwen3.5-2B now choose among up to **254 options**
> (v1.0: 26), with better calibration. On our long-list test the 0.8B goes from 40% to 95%. The 2B's benchmark score
> dips from 83.1% to 82.0%. Details in the [changelog](#changelog); v1.0 stays available on Hugging Face as
> revision `v1.0`.

**Fine-tunes of Qwen3.5 and Gemma 4 for zero-shot classification: small, fast decision models you slot into your
code, with the same request format as Jev.** You describe a situation and list the options in plain words; Jeff returns a
calibrated probability for each option from a single forward pass. No generated text, no parsing: about **22 ms** per
decision on an RTX PRO 6000 and **28 ms** on an Apple M4 Max (MLX).

Zero-shot means the options can be anything: support queues, user intents, moderation labels, voice commands, game
moves. Your categories don't need to appear in the training data; you describe them, and Jeff picks.

**What it is, and what it isn't.** These are very small models. They make extremely fast, well-calibrated judgement
calls between options, and they slot easily into your local code. On benchmarks they approach, and sometimes beat, Jev;
but at this size their reasoning won't match Jev's, which runs on a much larger model. If zero-shot accuracy isn't
good enough for your purposes, a short fine-tune on your own examples takes you much further: our
voice-navigation fine-tune moved held-out accuracy from 31.7% to 95.8% in under half an hour on one GPU.

**Built entirely on local hardware.** Training on one RTX PRO 6000 workstation GPU (the 0.8B trains in about 2 hours,
the 2B in about 3.5), all synthetic training data written by an open model (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) on two DGX Sparks,
testing on a MacBook. No cloud GPUs, and no closed-model output in the training data; a closed model was used only to
spot-check the quality of a sample of the synthetic data.

**Independent project.** Jeff uses the same request format as Jev, but it is not affiliated with or endorsed by TypeSafe, the
makers of Jev. Our training code starts from the open-source [AutoJev](https://github.com/denis-pplx/autojev) recipe.

**Models on Hugging Face:** [Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B](https://huggingface.co/mstrasser/Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B) · [Jeff-Qwen3.5-2B](https://huggingface.co/mstrasser/Jeff-Qwen3.5-2B) · [Jeff-Gemma4-E2B](https://huggingface.co/mstrasser/Jeff-Gemma4-E2B) · chess fine-tune: [Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B-Chess](https://huggingface.co/mstrasser/Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B-Chess)

## Quick start

To serve a model you only need the serving install (`--no-default-groups` leaves out the training, data and
evaluation packages; plain `uv sync` installs everything):

```bash
uv sync --no-default-groups                 # CPU
uv sync --no-default-groups --extra cuda    # NVIDIA GPU: adds the fast kernels (much slower without them)
uv sync --no-default-groups --extra mac     # Apple silicon: adds MLX
uv run --no-default-groups hf download mstrasser/Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B --local-dir checkpoints/jeff-0.8b

# NVIDIA GPU or CPU (PyTorch)
JEFF_CHECKPOINT=checkpoints/jeff-0.8b PORT=8765 uv run --no-default-groups jeff-serve
# Apple silicon (MLX, much faster on a Mac; Qwen models only)
JEFF_BACKEND=mlx JEFF_CHECKPOINT=checkpoints/jeff-0.8b PORT=8765 uv run --no-default-groups --extra mac jeff-serve
```

```bash
curl -s localhost:8765/v1/systemone -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "model": "jeff-latest",
  "state": "Refund request: the customer says the parcel arrived crushed and wants their money back.",
  "questions": {
    "route": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Which team should handle this?",
              "criteria": {"1": "Refunds and payments", "2": "Damaged or lost parcels", "3": "Account and login problems"}},
    "angry": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Is the customer angry?"}
  }
}'
```

Each answer has a probability per option, the chosen option and a confidence. Three question types: `choice` (pick one
of up to 254 options with the v1.1 Qwen models, 26 with Jeff-Gemma4-E2B), `noul` (yes/no, returned as a probability) and `score` (a point on a scale you describe).
Several independent questions in one request are answered together.

## Docker Compose (NVIDIA CUDA)

On a Linux x86-64 host with an NVIDIA GPU, a compatible NVIDIA driver and NVIDIA Container Toolkit,
save the following as `compose.yaml`. This uses the prebuilt image published by the `qtmleap/jeff` fork.
For Apple silicon GPU acceleration, use the native MLX command above.

```yaml
services:
  jeff:
    image: ghcr.io/qtmleap/jeff:latest
    init: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      JEFF_MODEL_REPO: mstrasser/Jeff-Qwen3.5-2B
    volumes:
      - models:/models
      - compile-cache:/cache
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
volumes:
  models:
  compile-cache:
```

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f jeff
```

The container downloads the model selected by `JEFF_MODEL_REPO` before starting Jeff, then reuses downloaded
files from the `models` volume on later starts. The image defaults to CUDA and listens on port 8765.
The model shown is also the default; omit `environment` to use it unchanged. Add `JEFF_MODEL_REVISION`
only to select a Hugging Face tag or commit SHA instead of the default `main`. No manual download or host model directory is needed.
The first start includes downloading the model and warming up inference, so allow time for it to become healthy.

There is no `ports` mapping: other services on the same Compose network use `http://jeff:8765`
(`/health` and `POST /v1/systemone`). The host-side `localhost:8765` example above applies to the native server.
`docker compose down` preserves the caches; `docker compose down -v` deletes them.
See [compose.yaml](compose.yaml) for the full configuration and the [Japanese CUDA guide](docs/docker-cuda.ja.md)
for driver requirements, health checks and troubleshooting.

## Benchmarks

4,599 questions from five public benchmarks, plus JevBench's public hard tier (105 items, scored separately):

![Accuracy of Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B, Jeff-Qwen3.5-2B and Jeff-Gemma4-E2B against Jev's published figures, per benchmark](assets/benchmarks.png)

| JevBench hard (separate) | 36.2 | 46.7 | 45.7 | 57.1 | 41.0 | 48.6 | **73.3** | 70.3 |

**Bold:** the winner of Jeff against Jev in each row. ***Bold italic:*** AutoJev-27B where it is the best of all models
in the row; it is shown for reference, since the head-to-head comparison is
with Jev. The Qwen columns are v1.1; Jeff-Gemma4-E2B is v1.0. The published Jev and AutoJev figures were measured on a different sample of the same benchmarks. Jeff's
overall score comes from classification and grounding, where it matches or beats the large models; on the
reasoning-heavy benchmarks (BBH, JudgeBench, JevBench) it stays well below them, as you would expect at this size.

## Games: a zero-shot test

*Measured with v1.0 of the Jeff models.*

To test zero-shot performance on tasks unlike anything in the benchmarks, we had Jeff play three games. Games aren't
the ideal zero-shot test, since a game's state isn't typical unstructured data; but they are a common, and fun, way to
test a System 1 model. Each turn, the code describes the situation and the legal moves in words, and the model picks
one. The options state what each move leads to (Frogger: "you would be hit by a car and lose a life"; Doom: "the
nearest monster is a little to your left"), but never which move is right. Each result is 20 episodes, seed 1234; ▶
opens a video of the run's first episode.

Jeff-0.8B decides in 29–49 ms per move on an M4 Max; Jev's published Doom run took 212 ms per call over its API. The
two times were not measured on the same hardware. To play them yourself:

```bash
uv sync --extra games
uv run python -m jeff.games --game doom --player jeff --criteria situation --url http://127.0.0.1:8765 --video --out runs/games/doom.json
uv run python -m jeff.games --game frogger --player jeff --criteria outcomes --url http://127.0.0.1:8765 --out runs/games/frogger.json
uv run python -m jeff.games --game pacman --player rule --out runs/games/pacman-rule.json
```

## Fine-tuning example: chess

When zero-shot isn't enough, fine-tune. As a worked example we trained Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B on 600,000 Lichess positions,
labelled by Stockfish, in about 3½ hours on one GPU. On 1,000 held-out chess puzzles:

| Model | Puzzles solved |
|---|---|
| Qwen3.5-0.8B, untrained | 6.2% |
| Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B, zero-shot (no chess training) | 15.5% |
| **[Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B-Chess](https://huggingface.co/mstrasser/Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B-Chess)** | **55.8%** |

It is not a strong player: about 1,000 Elo with no search, and it loses to Stockfish's weakest setting. The point is
speed. Each move is one forward pass in tens of milliseconds, so one GPU keeps up with about 600 human blitz games at
once.

<a href="https://huggingface.co/mstrasser/Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B-Chess"><img src="assets/previews/chess-game63.gif" width="720"
alt="Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B-Chess playing 100 blitz games at once; the featured game ends in checkmate"></a>

100 games at once in real time; the featured game is its one win of the 100, a nine-move checkmate. The full video,
results and training details are on the [model card](https://huggingface.co/mstrasser/Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B-Chess). The code to
reproduce it, step by step, is in [examples/chess](examples/chess).

## Speed and size

Median time per decision over the same 200 benchmark questions (about 200 input tokens each), one question at a time,
from raw text to probabilities:

| Model | Parameters | Weights (16-bit) | NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 | Apple M4 Max (MLX) | CPU (32 threads) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B** | 0.8B | 1.7 GB | **22 ms** | **28 ms** | 463 ms |
| Jeff-Qwen3.5-2B | 2B | 4.2 GB | 24 ms | 60 ms | 708 ms |
| Jeff-Gemma4-E2B | 2B effective (4.6B stored) | 9.3 GB | 29 ms | — (MLX runs Qwen only) | 1.0 s |
| AutoJev-27B | 27B | ~54 GB | not published | — | — |
| Jev | not disclosed | API only | 114–212 ms per call in published Doom runs, including the network | | |

## Using it well

- **Reason in code, decide with Jeff.** It's a classifier, not a planner. State what each option leads to ("this move
  gets you hit by a car"); asked to forecast ("a car arrives in 2 turns"), it does no better than random.
- **Wording matters enormously.** Describe options consistently: giving Frogger's goal option the same words as every
  other forward option took one episode from 15 crossings to 23.
- **Use short option keys and descriptive text:** `{"1": "Engagement letter"}`, not long IDs, which cost time and add
  nothing.
- **Ask independent questions together** in one request.
- **Fine-tune it if zero-shot isn't enough.** A voice-navigation fine-tune on ~11k app-specific examples took about half
  an hour on one GPU and moved held-out accuracy from 31.7% to 95.8%, at about 40 ms per decision on an M4 Max:
  `jeff-train --initial-checkpoint <jeff> --epochs 1 ...`.
- **Pick the size for the job.** For fast option picking the 0.8B is the sweet spot: the 2B is more cautious and plays
  the games worse, despite scoring higher on the benchmarks.

## Train your own

```bash
uv run jeff-mix ...          # build the training set (public data, synthetic data, leak filter)
scripts/train.sh RUN data/mix/public.jsonl data/mix 5e-6 40 Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B <revision> --epochs 1
uv run jeff-evaluate --data data/panel.jsonl --local --checkpoint checkpoints/RUN/final --output runs/eval/RUN.json
```

The full pipeline (synthetic data from a local teacher, leak filter, learning-rate sweeps, dashboard) is described in
[scripts/train_all.sh](https://github.com/firelex/jeff/blob/main/scripts/train_all.sh), and every training source with its licence in [docs/data-sources.md](https://github.com/firelex/jeff/blob/main/docs/data-sources.md). Training recipe: full-weight fine-tuning, one epoch, batches of 256, cross-entropy over the
option letters, then one fitted temperature for calibration. From v1.1 we use the checkpoint at the end of the epoch; the benchmark
panel is never used for selection or tuning. At least half of each training family follows the panel's layout conventions (formats only; no panel
item is ever trained on).

## Caveats

- **Option limits.** The v1.1 Qwen models are trained on lists of 20 to 254 options and accept up to 254.
  Jeff-Gemma4-E2B is still v1.0: it picks reliably among at most 26, and the server refuses longer lists for it;
  shortlist first.
- **Small models don't reason.** Expect fast, calibrated choices between the options you describe, not multi-step
  reasoning. At 0.8B–2B parameters this holds for every model, not just Jeff.
- **Jeff-2B is a weaker game player than Jeff-0.8B.** The untrained 2B already appears more risk-averse than the
  untrained 0.8B, and our training seems to have made that worse. This needs more investigation.
- **Benchmark scores don't predict game play.** The untrained Gemma 4 E2B beats the untrained Qwen models on the
  benchmarks yet plays the games worst: right most of the time, but not reliably. Training fixed its Pac-Man (3.2 → 53.2 pellets)
  but not its Doom or Frogger.
- **Prompts matter.** Jev's own Doom prompt (a raw bearing number plus an aiming rule) does not work for any of our
  models; options that state consequences in words do.
- **English and text only.**

## Changelog

**v1.1 (29 September 2026): Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B and Jeff-Qwen3.5-2B**
- **Long lists.** v1.0 never picked an option past the 26th, because no training question had more than 19 options
  (thanks to @puhuk for the report, [#1](https://github.com/firelex/jeff/issues/1)). v1.1 adds 32,000 training questions
  with 20 to 254 options, built in code ([`src/jeff/longlists.py`](src/jeff/longlists.py)) and from the MASSIVE and
  CLINC150 training splits, and accepts up to 254 options. Long-list test (20 to 254 items): 0.8B 40.3% → 94.7%, 2B 95.2%.
- **Final checkpoint.** v1.1 publishes the checkpoint at the end of the epoch. Picking the one with the lowest
  development loss, as v1.0 did, chose an early, less settled checkpoint in the new runs and cost 1–2 points.
- **Calibration** error 0.049 → 0.021 (0.8B) and 0.028 → 0.026 (2B). JevBench hard tier: 47.6% → 46.7% (0.8B),
  53.3% → 57.1% (2B).
- **Benchmarks:** 0.8B unchanged at 79.1%; 2B 83.1% → 82.0%, mostly on JudgeBench (64.6% → 59.4%), a small benchmark
  where models of this size sit near chance. The 2B no longer edges past Jev's published 83.0%.
- **Not zero-shot any more:** MASSIVE and CLINC150 (their training splits are now in the training data).
- **Serving-only install** (`uv sync --no-default-groups`), thanks to @WavesMan ([#2](https://github.com/firelex/jeff/issues/2)).
- Jeff-Gemma4-E2B was not retrained and stays at v1.0. v1.0 of every model stays available on Hugging Face as revision
  `v1.0`.

**v1.0 (28 September 2026):** first release: Jeff-Qwen3.5-0.8B, Jeff-Qwen3.5-2B and Jeff-Gemma4-E2B.

## History

Jeff began as a fork of [AutoJev](https://github.com/denis-pplx/autojev) by Denis Yarats (MIT licence), an open recipe
that fine-tunes Qwen3.8-27B to return Jev-style decisions. We kept its core design (one forward pass per decision, a
trained answer readout, a fitted temperature for calibration) and built on it: small students (0.8B and 2B Qwen, Gemma
4 E2B), a local synthetic-data pipeline with a leak filter, prompt layouts for domain fine-tunes, MLX serving on Apple
silicon, game tests and a training dashboard. The original copyright notice is kept in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
